# Auto-Assignment Features

## Overview
The ticketing dashboard now includes intelligent auto-assignment functionality that automatically assigns tickets based on user roles and interactions.

## Auto-Assignment Logic

### 1. Agent Creates Ticket
When an **Agent** or **Admin** creates a ticket:
- The ticket is automatically assigned to them (`assigned_to_id = currentUser.id`)
- The `requester_id` is also set to their ID
- This is useful for agents creating tickets on behalf of customers or for internal issues

### 2. Customer Creates Ticket
When a **Customer** creates a ticket:
- The ticket is created with `assigned_to_id = null` (unassigned)
- The `requester_id` is set to the customer's ID
- The ticket remains unassigned until the first agent responds

### 3. First Agent Response Auto-Assignment
When an **Agent** or **Admin** first comments on an unassigned ticket:
- The ticket is automatically assigned to the commenting agent
- This follows the "first to respond owns it" principle
- If the ticket is already assigned, no changes are made

## Implementation Details

### New API Functions

- **`getTicketById()`**: Helper function to fetch complete ticket data

### Enhanced Ticket Creation
- **TicketForm**: Now includes user context and auto-assignment logic
- **Data Fix**: Improved ticket creation to ensure complete data is returned (fixes display issue)

### Visual Indicators
- **Assignment Status**: Cards and details now show "Created by" and "Assigned to" information
- **Unassigned Tickets**: Clearly marked with orange "Unassigned" label
- **Role Display**: Shows user roles alongside names for better context

## User Experience Improvements

### For Agents
- When creating tickets, they're automatically assigned to you
- When commenting on unassigned tickets, you automatically take ownership
- Clear visibility of ticket assignment status

### For Customers
- Your tickets show as "Unassigned" until an agent responds
- You can see which agent is handling your ticket once assigned
- Clear indication of who created each ticket

### For Admins
- Full visibility and control over all assignments
- Same auto-assignment behavior as agents
- Can see complete assignment history

## Technical Benefits

2. **Ownership Clarity**: Clear responsibility assignment
3. **Efficient Workflow**: Reduces manual assignment overhead
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete assignment tracking
5. **Role-Based Logic**: Different behavior based on user permissions

## Display Enhancements

### Comments

## Data Flow

1. **Ticket Creation** → Auto-assign if agent, leave unassigned if customer
2. **Agent Comments** → Check assignment status → Auto-assign if unassigned
3. **State Management** → Refresh ticket list to reflect changes
4. **UI Updates** → Display current assignment status

This auto-assignment system ensures efficient ticket management while maintaining a smooth user experience for all roles.
